# üöÄ Digital Transformation Strategy

As a Technical Project Manager, I drive digital transformation initiatives that modernize outdated business processes, eliminate manual toil, and integrate SaaS platforms into secure, auditable, and efficient systems. My focus is on practical, high-impact changes that align enterprise tools with real operational needs‚Äîespecially in finance, operations, and compliance-heavy environments.

## üß≠ Strategic Focus Areas

### Process Modernization
- Identify pain points in legacy workflows, from intake to reconciliation.
- Eliminate bottlenecks and reduce manual overhead through automation.
- Redesign processes for scale, auditability, and cross-functional clarity.

### SaaS Integration
- Connect cloud tools through native APIs, low-code platforms, or file-based automation.
- Standardize data handoffs across tools like NetSuite, Ramp, Box, Vena, and Smartsheet.
- Validate and enrich transactions before pushing to ERP or financial systems.

### ERP Alignment & Governance
- Ensure integrations respect ERP data structures, audit standards, and approval policies.
- Leverage SuiteScript, CSV imports, and business rules to enforce compliance.
- Collaborate with finance teams to test, validate, and adopt sustainable workflows.

## üìå Accounts Payable Transformation ‚Äì Ramp + NetSuite

### Background  
Before the transformation, the AP process relied entirely on manual data management:

- Ramp transactions were exported and coded after the fact using spreadsheet ‚Äúcover sheets.‚Äù
- GL account, department, and vendor coding were inconsistent and lacked validation.
- Transactions were uploaded into NetSuite manually via CSV imports.
- AP aging was tracked using static spreadsheets with no real-time visibility.
- No integration existed between Ramp and NetSuite, increasing close-cycle delays and audit risk.

### Strategic Objective  
Leverage Ramp‚Äôs **native NetSuite integration (Ramp Plus)** to:
- Eliminate manual entry,
- Improve coding accuracy,
- Establish real-time AP visibility,
- And reduce Finance workload during monthly close.

### My Role  
- Facilitated working sessions with Finance and IT to document the current AP process.
- Coordinated the activation and configuration of **Ramp‚Äôs NetSuite integration**.
- Cleaned and prepared historical transaction data for ERP ingestion.
- Supported mapping logic setup between Ramp and NetSuite fields.
- Led testing and validation to ensure reliable journal sync and GL alignment.
- Worked with stakeholders to retire spreadsheet tracking and adopt ERP-based aging reports.

### Key Improvements  
| Area | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Transaction Coding | Manual, post-facto in spreadsheets | Applied in Ramp interface or during approval |
| ERP Sync | Manual CSV uploads | Native, near-real-time integration |
| AP Aging | Static spreadsheet tracking | NetSuite-based real-time reporting |
| Data Quality | Inconsistent, error-prone | Standardized, validated via Ramp-NetSuite sync |
| Close Process | High-effort, high-friction | Reduced time and error rate |

### Tools Used  
Ramp Plus ‚Ä¢ NetSuite ‚Ä¢ Smartsheet (interim tracking) ‚Ä¢ Excel (cleanup and mapping)

## üì¶ File Intake Streamlining ‚Äì Box ‚Üí Vena

### Background  
Forecast files submitted by business units were uploaded to Box manually, then manually tracked and ingested into Vena by Finance. This process was highly error-prone:

- Files were sometimes overwritten, mislabeled, or delayed.
- Upload confirmations required manual email chains.
- Ingestion into Vena was inconsistent due to naming issues and misaligned templates.

### My Role  
- Documented the file intake process and mapped gaps in traceability.
- Introduced file tracking via Smartsheet to capture who submitted what, when, and where.
- Standardized folder structure and file naming conventions in Box.
- Coordinated with the Vena team to align ingestion expectations with naming/format requirements.

### Outcome  
- Increased visibility into file submission timelines.
- Reduced risk of missing or misprocessed forecasts.
- Improved Finance team confidence in submission completeness and readiness.

### Tools Used  
Box ‚Ä¢ Smartsheet ‚Ä¢ Vena ‚Ä¢ Manual QA processes

## üßæ Vendor Onboarding Intake Modernization

### Background  
Vendor creation was previously managed through static Word/PDF forms and email submissions. The process was unstructured, often incomplete, and lacked a central tracking source.

### My Role  
- Developed a Smartsheet-based vendor request intake form with required fields and validation rules.
- Tracked status of submissions, approvals, and data QA within a centralized sheet.
- Partnered with the Finance team to ensure consistent GL and vendor master alignment before NetSuite entry.
- Helped reduce inbox congestion and standardize data formats submitted for entry.

### Outcome  
- Streamlined vendor intake and reduced cycle time.
- Reduced rework caused by incomplete submissions.
- Established a scalable model for other intake processes (e.g., employee expense setup).

### Tools Used  
Smartsheet ‚Ä¢ NetSuite Vendor Master ‚Ä¢ Email (for approvals)

## üß† Strategic Takeaways

- **Start with the pain point, not the platform.** Success came from understanding the day-to-day friction teams experienced‚Äînot just from pushing tools.
- **Native integrations are only valuable when properly configured.** Even out-of-the-box connections require business alignment, cleanup, and governance.
- **Manual workarounds are process red flags.** Spreadsheets, email approvals, and static tracking often hide process debt that should be retired.
- **Change management is 50% of the job.** Workflows that aren‚Äôt adopted, tested, and supported fail regardless of technical merit.
