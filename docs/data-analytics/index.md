# 📈 Data Analytics

Data enables visibility, action, and accountability. In my role as a Technical Project Manager, I use analytics to identify delivery risks, expose operational inefficiencies, and improve cross-functional coordination. This page highlights applied analytics across real-world projects and graduate-level training, with a focus on execution—not abstraction.

## 🛠 Real-World Analytics in Practice

### ✅ Asana AI Reporting for Project Risk

- Used Asana’s built-in AI tools to surface risk indicators, missed deadlines, and task velocity drops across parallel workstreams.
- Automated report exports used in weekly status calls with product owners and technical leads.
- Provided leadership with early warnings and improved sprint closure predictability.

### 📊 Service Ops Dashboards via Smartsheet

- Designed Smartsheet dashboards to visualize NetSuite ticket volume, aging trends, and SLA performance.
- Enabled Finance, IT, and Operations leaders to review open issues by type and urgency, reducing misalignment and response lag.
- Created automated alerts for ticket stalling, improving average resolution time.

### 🔁 Cross-Platform ETL Automation

- **Python-based ETL**: Automated Box → Vena upload pipelines for forecast files, validating naming conventions and structure before delivery.
- **SQL for Ad Hoc Analytics**: Used to query transactional records and support reporting use cases in internal tools.
- **Power Automate Pipelines**:
  - Outlook-to-Smartsheet parsing for onboarding and intake tickets.
  - Teams post tracking to Smartsheet for HR and IT coordination.
  - Structured input layers for multi-department workflows.

📌 Result: Eliminated spreadsheet ping-pong, improved handoff accuracy, and increased confidence in reporting fidelity.

## 📈 Project Metrics & Governance

Analytics used in technical program delivery includes:

| Metric Type            | Example Use Case                                                |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sprint velocity        | Trend velocity drops and delivery bottlenecks across work items |
| Ticket backlog aging   | Track SLA compliance and triage urgency                         |
| Forecast accuracy      | Validate project timelines and onboarding cycles                |
| Reconciliation metrics | Ensure ERP record sync between Ramp, NetSuite, and Smartsheet   |

I embed these insights into status meetings, retrospectives, and stakeholder communications to ground decision-making in data, not assumptions.
