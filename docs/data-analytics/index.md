## 🎓 Graduate-Level Analytics Experience

### Data-Driven Decision Making

In this course, I designed a workplace data strategy to combat the opioid crisis by promoting alternative pain management treatments. The result: a structured program called **PainSmart**, which used both quantitative and qualitative analysis to forecast outcomes and assess impact.

**Key Components:**

- **Hypothesis Design**: Reducing opioid prescriptions through holistic health interventions
- **Forecasting Analysis**: Trend projection of opioid prescriptions without intervention vs. with MBSR, chiropractic, and yoga options
- **Statistical Evaluation**: Applied paired *t*-tests to assess significance of outcome changes
- **Tooling**: Data visualization planned in Power BI/Tableau; qualitative surveys for engagement analysis

> 📌 Outcome: Designed a multi-phase program rollout with tracked KPIs and analytics dashboards to support HR, executive leadership, and healthcare provider coordination.

### Data Analytics

This course built analytical fluency in statistics, Excel modeling, and strategic data storytelling. I completed structured assignments and a multi-phase final project focused on:

- Descriptive & inferential statistics (central tendency, correlation, regression)
- Excel-based data modeling and visualization
- Business case analysis with scenario forecasting
- Delivering stakeholder-facing insight presentations

> 📌 Outcome: Delivered an end-to-end analytics pipeline — from dataset selection and hypothesis framing to insight communication and executive reporting.

## 🛠️ Real-World Analytics Projects

### AI-Powered Program Dashboards
Built an Asana AI + ChatGPT-enabled project insight engine to flag schedule risk, velocity drops, and delivery gaps. Replaced 100+ hours/month of manual PM report prep.

### ERP-Ticket Analytics & Service KPIs
Led development of NetSuite-integrated KPI dashboards tracking volume, resolution time, SLA compliance, and root-cause analysis across 350+ tickets/month. Drove 30% faster resolutions through automated insight loops.

### Retail & Compliance Analytics
Statistically analyzed 100+ retail self-checkout lanes to increase adoption by 45%. Used Python/VBScript pipelines to build compliance and patch reporting dashboards for eWIC systems.
