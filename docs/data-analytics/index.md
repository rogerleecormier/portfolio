## 🎓 Academic Foundation: BUS563 – Data Analytics

In BUS563, I applied core analytical concepts to business problems using a structured, project-based approach. Deliverables emphasized data quality, statistical analysis, visualization, and stakeholder storytelling.

**Key Competencies:**

- Descriptive & inferential statistics (hypothesis testing, regression)
- Excel-based data modeling and visualization
- Strategic interpretation of analytics for decision support
- Communicating actionable insights through visual storytelling

**Capstone Project Phases:**

1. **Dataset Evaluation** – Identified data variables and designed a strategy for central tendency and visual summaries
2. **Hypothesis Development** – Proposed and validated statistical relationships using t-tests and regression
3. **Insight Delivery** – Created executive-facing data interpretations and next-step recommendations

Course Outcomes Mapped:
- CO1: Articulated data’s role in competitive advantage
- CO2: Used analytics to drive strategic choices
- CO3: Distinguished valid vs. flawed analyses
- CO5: Delivered stakeholder-ready insight reports
