## 🎓 Graduate‑Level Coursework Highlights

| Assignment (Excel)                     | Purpose & Skills Demonstrated | Key Takeaway |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| **Descriptive Statistics**             | Mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, five‑number summary | Established baseline opioid‑related metrics for Dayton vs. state averages |
| **Comparison of Means (t‑Test)**       | Two‑sample t‑test (equal/unequal variance), confidence intervals | Showed that alternative‑therapy employers have statistically lower opioid‑prescription counts (p < 0.05) |
| **Correlation & Regression**           | Pearson r, scatterplots, simple linear regression, \(R^{2}\) | Identified strong positive correlation (r ≈ 0.82) between opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths; regression model explains ~67 % of variance |
| **Data‑Driven Advertisement**          | Data visualization & storytelling | Translated regression output into a one‑page ad advocating employer‑funded MBSR and chiropractic care |
| **ANOVA (3‑Group)**                    | One‑way ANOVA + post‑hoc planning | F = 0.91, p = 0.437 → no significant overdose‑rate difference among Urban, Suburban, Rural areas |
| **Time‑Series Forecasting**            | Excel Forecast Sheet, moving average, MAPE | Projected 5‑year opioid‑death trend; baseline model indicates plateau by Year 3 under PainSmart intervention |

## 💊 *PainSmart* Alternative Pain‑Management Strategy

Built on the assignments above, *PainSmart* is a data‑informed wellness program designed to curb opioid reliance through holistic treatments (chiropractic, yoga, MBSR).

- **Forecasting Model:** Excel projections show potential **5 % annual reduction** in opioid prescriptions with program adoption.
- **Business Case:** T‑test evidence plus regression savings model supports lower healthcare spend and higher employee retention.
